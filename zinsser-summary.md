# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Darien Vidaure

Zinserrâ€™s main point is to simplify writing to avoid clutter and have clarity. This is done by removing words that provide no value, usually prepositions, adverbs, and adjectives. Replacing long words with short words that mean the same thing also provides clarity. Clutter is found almost everywhere in the world which makes it difficult to avoid. Zinserr states that writing this way is hard work because it requires rewriting multiple times to remove clutter. Clear thinking (minds free of clutter) also results in clear writing which makes it easier for readers to understand the writer.
